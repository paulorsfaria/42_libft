unsigned char is used on strncmp to handle the negative numbers
why is size_t used?
size_t is the same as unsigned int(so it cant be negative) plus its normally used to 
(Type (int, char ...) convert before sending 



calloc gets the size of bits(char, int blah blah blah) and the lenght so its like malloc (type * lenght)
